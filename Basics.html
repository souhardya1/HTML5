        <hr>
        <p>
            <b>My hero is Naruto Uzumaki.</b>
            When
            <i>Naruto was a child he didn't get used to people</i>
            he was always a goof ball cause he wanted people to know his name and who he really is.
            But the people in the village don't like him cause there was a monster inside him that his parents sealed away in order to protect their village.
            When Naruto became a ninja he
            <mark>was put in a team of a group of 4 people.</mark>
            The group was always two men and one woman the last one is the sensei.
            The sensei can be a man or a woman. Naruto sensei name is Kakashi.
            Naruto team was name Team 7.
            <del>Team 7 had lots of missions and every mission they do that is dangerous
                 Naruto has made friends with them even if they're from different villages.
            </del>
            Naruto wants to accomplish his dream to become the best hokage ever.</p>
        <pre>
            Naruto is an orphan who has a dangerous fox-like entity known as Kurama the Nine-Tailed Fox sealed within his body by his father,
            the Fourth Hokage Minato Namikaze, the leader of Konoha's ninja force, at the cost of his own life and that of his wife, Kushina Uzumaki.
            This possession led to Naruto being ridiculed frequently by the rest of Konoha; being associated with him was considered taboo.
            As a youth, Naruto makes jokes and plays pranks to attract attention.Desiring what he lacked in his early life.

        <h2>Naruto Uzumaki</h2>
        <hr>
        <img src="images/htmlpurpose.jpg">
        <p>
            Naruto was born on the night of October 10th to Minato Namikaze (the Fourth Hokage) and Kushina Uzumaki (the second jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails).
            He was named after Naruto Musasabi, the protagonist of Jiraiya's first book, which made the Sannin his godfather.
            The Third Hokage made special arrangements for Minato to preserve Kushina's seal containing the Nine-Tails while she gave birth to Naruto in a remote location, escorted by midwives and Anbu.
            A masked man, Tobi, tracked down their location, however, killed the midwives and Anbu, and captured Naruto, forcing Minato to quickly rescue him and teleport him to a safe house.
            With Minato gone, Tobi captured Kushina and released the Nine-Tails from her, using it to devastate Konoha.
            Minato saved Kushina and left Naruto in her care before he went to protect the village,[16] eventually defeating Tobi and freeing the Nine-Tails from Tobi's control.
            Returning to Naruto and Kushina's location, Minato realised the only way to stop the Nine-Tails was to seal it within Naruto, believing that his son would someday need the fox's power to defeat Tobi when he returned.
            [17] Since the Nine-Tails' chakra was too immense to be sealed into an infant, Minato sacrificed his soul to split the fox's chakra in half, sealing the Yin half within himself and the Yang half within Naruto.
            After telling Naruto how much they loved him, Minato and Kushina succumbed to their wounds from protecting their son from the Nine-Tails and passed away.
            Orphaned, not having parents or anyone else to provide for him, Naruto received monthly income from the village in order to afford daily necessities.
            Naruto grew up not knowing who his parents were, receiving only his mother's surname, as Hiruzen wanted to protect Naruto from his father's enemies.
            Minato's dying wish that Naruto be regarded as a hero was honoured by the very few who could put aside their pain and losses caused by the disaster, while the majority of Konoha,
            however having no knowledge of the circumstances surrounding his birth, openly ostracised and resented Naruto for containing the beast that devastated the village and took many lives;
            some even viewed Naruto as the Nine-Tails itself. Soon, the Third Hokage forbade anyone from mentioning the Nine-Tails, hoping that the younger generation would not blindly hate Naruto as their parents did.
            Upon confronting it, he learned to be at peace with it, willingly becoming greater than what he suffered.

        <p >Kakashi Hatake is introduced as the Jonin (elite ninja) leader in charge of Team 7,
            a new ninja team including Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno.
            He first appears as a carefree character as he tends to lose track of time,
            and is frequently late to his appointments as a result.[19] However, when testing his students,
            Kakashi reveals himself as a strong opponent to the point where he fights while reading Make Out series of erotic novels.
            Kakashi is renowned throughout the Naruto world for the use of his Sharingan which he received from his teammate Obito Uchiha during the third shinobi world war
            and is revered as the ninja who has copied over a thousand jutsus,
            earning him the moniker "Copy Ninja Kakashi" and "Kakashi of the Sharingan" .
            The Sharingan grants him the ability to mimic the movements and jutsu of others.[21][22] Although most of Kakashi's abilities were acquired with his Sharingan,
            he also invented the Chidori (千鳥, lit. "One Thousand Birds") and its Lightning Blade variation, a collection of lightning chakra in one's hand that uses the Sharingan's visual ability to lock onto a target.

            Sasuke is introduced in Part I as a young, spiky-black-haired pre-teen wearing a blue shirt with an image of a fan that represents his clan on its back.
            He also wears short white pants and a Konohagakure headband. Early in the series, Orochimaru brands Sasuke with a Cursed Seal that,
            when activated, covers his body with black marks and later gives him gray skin, white hair, and claw-like wings.
            In Part II, he is normally depicted wearing a white kimono and black pants. Although he is skilled in the use of shuriken, in Part II Sasuke uses a chokutō sword that he calls Kusanagi.
            In addition to using Kusanagi for swordsmanship, Sasuke combines it with lightning-based techniques to increase the power of his attacks.
            In The Last: Naruto the Movie, his adult wardrobe consists of gray pants and a light-brown cloak over a black shirt, while in Boruto: Naruto the Movie, he wears black pants and a black cape over a lilac vest.
            Sasuke is a silent character who tries to gain more power and kill his older brother, Itachi, for betraying and murdering their clan.
            He cares about his teammates and saves them on numerous occasions,but he severs all of his bonds later in Part I, believing this will strengthen him.
            Sasuke is moved when Naruto Uzumaki wants him to make peace with the village; he considers Naruto his only friend.
            Sasuke becomes more kindhearted by the end of the series, but he decides not to return home, chooses to redeem himself, and searches for an enemy threatening the peace of Konohagakure.
            Sasuke is the second and youngest son of Mikoto and Fugaku Uchiha; they named him after Sasuke Sarutobi in the hopes that he would someday be just as strong of a shinobi.
            Sasuke grew up in the shadow of his older brother, Itachi, a natural prodigy who many in the Uchiha clan and the village would constantly compare Sasuke and any of his accomplishments to.
            Sasuke himself adored Itachi, never passing up an opportunity to spend time with him. Although Itachi welcomed his company, letting Sasuke watch him train and taking him on adventures into the forests,
            Itachi in return rarely helped Sasuke himself become a better shinobi; when asked, he would often instead poke Sasuke's forehead and promise to do so some other time. Sasuke found this annoying,
            but didn't allow it to blemish his high opinion of his brother.

        <h2 id="sakura">Sakura</h2>
        <hr>
        <img src="images/unnamed (1).jpg">
        <p>
            Sakura is a young ninja who is a part of Team 7 alongside Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha under the leadership of their sensei Kakashi Hatake.[15] Within Sakura resides "Inner Sakura",
            a manifestation of her inner emotions; in addition to comic relief, Inner Sakura represents Sakura's actual opinion on things when she outwardly displays something opposite.
            As Sakura has a deep infatuation for Sasuke, many of her earlier appearances are dedicated to her continued effort to win his affection.
            She accompanies the rest of Team 7 during all of its early missions, though she does little to contribute to the battles that take place.
            Sakura lacks any unique traits that would set her apart from the rest of Team 7, although Kakashi notes that she has an excellent control over her chakra early in Part I.
            As a result, Sakura stays on the sidelines, content in allowing her teammates to protect her and defeat their opponents. During the Chunin Exams, when the rest of Team 7 is left in need of her protection,
            Sakura realizes that relying on others to fight her battles has been unwise. She resolves to better her ninja abilities from that point further,
            and she takes a more active role in Team 7's battles throughout the rest of the series. After Sasuke's defection from Konohagakure at the end of Part I,
            Naruto's failure to bring him back,[19] and Sakura's inability to help either of them, she becomes Tsunade's apprentice so that she can do more for her teammates in the future.
            Since then, Sakura makes it her personal goal to bring Sasuke home.
